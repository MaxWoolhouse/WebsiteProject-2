			<li><b> I have used appropriate tools and techniques for the purpose and end users.</b><br>
            For example, I have created a website using html/css with an external stylesheet. The material is structured and formatted using a range of tags and styles. It has clear headings, body text and lists/bullets if required.
         </li>
         <br/>
         <li><b>I have applied appropriate data integrity and testing procedures.</b><br> 
            For example, the site has been tested/previewed either in two unrelated browsers.The text has been proof read and there are no obvious spelling/grammatical issues.
         </li>
         <br/>
         <li><b>I have used relevant conventions.</b> <br>
            For example, design elements such as contrast, repetition, alignment, proximity and white space to lay out their site.
         </li>
         <br/>
         <li><b>I have explained relevant implications.</b><br>
            For example, I have explained why copyright should be honoured/images should be credited. I have mentioned why the site should be accessible for colour blind/visually impaired users. I have stated why their site should be easy to navigate (the site may have minor navigation issues).
         </li>
         <br/>
         <li><b>I can define the purpose of the digital media outcome and the requirements of the end users.</b><br>
            I investigated many examples to learn about website design and current design trends. I can generate and model a range of design ideas. For example, I have  created a series of possible site layouts. I have experimented with different colour, background and font options. I have sketched wireframes for the initial layout of the page followed by mock-ups showing various options.
         </li>
         <br/>
         <li><b>I can explain relevant implications.</b><br>
            For example, I have mentioned the importance of honouring copyright and privacy (e.g. getting permission from students whose photos appear in the site). I have explained why the site needs to be aesthetically pleasing, fully functional, easy to use and accessible.
